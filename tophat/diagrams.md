# Cummerbund diagram explanations 

## Dispersion plots
A scatter plot comparing the mean counts (FPKM) against the estimated dispersion (As a deviation from a threshold value) for a given level of
features from a cuffdiff run.

## csBoxplot
This plot displays summary statistics of FPKM values

## csDendro
This makes a dendrogram (tree) which shows the Jensen-Shannon distances between the conditions. The JS distance is defined as the square root of the JS divergance, which is based on the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence. Both deal with a calculation of the amount of *information* lost when one *set* is used to approximate another *set*

## csDistHeat
This makes a heat map which compares each sample based again on the JS distance

## PCA plot
This one is pretty obvious
